YouTube Data API v3 Playground
==============================

Nothing to see here, move along. If you decide to stay, you will find some tryouts related to the Youtube Data API
here. If you find a snippet or two worth copy & pasting into your code - go ahead and fork off :)

If you decide to tinker with the code, make sure to create a config.js file next to main.js, an example config file
is provided (config.js.dist)

todo: looking at the code it should be obvious that the code has been hacked together.

* [ ] Move all database related stuff into a dedicated module
* [ ] Move youtube related code into a dedicated module
* [ ] perhaps replace all remaining callback patterns with a q / promise based approach
* [ ] cleanup expired entries
